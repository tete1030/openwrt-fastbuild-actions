# Customize here for any additional package you want to install
# Packages will be put into 'package/openwrt-packages' dir
# Note that to have it compiled, you also have to set its CONFIG_* options
# The format is:
# PACKAGE_NAME PACKAGE_GIT [ref=REF] [root=ROOT] [subdir=SUBDIR] [rename=RENAME] [mkfile-dir=MKFILE_DIR] [use-latest-tag] [override]
# REF is optional. You can specify branch/tag/commit
# ROOT is optional. Specifying the parent path under 'package/' of this package. Defaults to 'openwrt-packages'.
# SUBDIR is optional. The path of subdir within the repo can be specified
# RENAME is optional. It allows renaming of PKG_NAME in Makefile of the package
# MKFILE_DIR is optional. You can specify the dir of Makefile, only used when RENAME is specified.
# 'use-latest-tag' will retrieve latest release as the REF. It shouldn't be specified together with REF. Currently only github repo is supported.
# 'override' will delete packages that are already existed.
